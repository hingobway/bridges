# Bridge Calculations

### Mathematical Rundown
Here is a map of the forces in use here.

As a force of gravity, related to the piece of bridge being supported, it can be said that $G=mg$, and that $m=\tau x$, where $\tau$ is the density of the bridge (constant) and $x$ is the distance.

Therefore:
$$tg\alpha=\frac{G}{T}=\frac{\tau xg}{T}$$
We now simplify this expression by adding a single constant $\mu$:
$$\mu=\frac{\tau g}{T}$$
And with that we have the usable expression of force
$$tg\alpha=\mu x$$

The angle $\alpha$ will be the slope of the force $F$, which is the tangent line of the catenary. That point in terms of location $x$ will be the derivative of the equation of the catenary.
